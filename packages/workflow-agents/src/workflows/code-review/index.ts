/**
 * Code-review workflow — the root Render Workflow task.
 *
 * Importing this module registers the `code-review` task *and* one task per
 * shared agent (the top-level `agentTask(...)` calls). Inside the task body,
 * `prepareDiff` runs in-process and each reviewer runs as its own chained Render
 * task via `Promise.all` — the same fan-out as naive-agent and worker-agents, but each agent in
 * its own isolated instance.
 *
 * The agents themselves come from @workshop/agent — identical to the ones the
 * naive and worker patterns run.
